# Project 1

Using gapminder, the following variables were tested in a "Bubbles" visualization:

Energy use (X-axis, log scale)
Extreme poverty (Y-axis)
Relative Poverty (Color)
Babies per woamn (Size)

Then, countries of interest were selected from the right-hand list.
For example, The United States, Niger, Guatemala, and China represent a good diversity of countries that all behave a little differently. Also, if energy use is put on a linear scale, it is easier to see a curve formed by the two axis variables.
