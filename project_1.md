# Project 1

Using gapminder, the following variables were tested in a "Bubbles" visualization:

Energy use (X-axis, log scale)  
Extreme poverty (Y-axis)  
Relative Poverty (Color) | Life Expectancy (Color) (There is data missing for relative poverty)  
Babies per woman (Size)  

Then, countries of interest were selected from the right-hand list.
For example, The United States, Niger, Guatemala, and China represent a good diversity of countries that all behave a little differently. Also, if energy use is put on a linear scale, it is easier to see a curve formed by the two axis variables.

It is interesting to see when certain countries move upwards, such as South Africa or Uzbekistan. 
It is also interesting to see when life expectancy (color) does not fit the rest of the curve.
Otherwise, it seems that energy use is a good metric showing development. It is unlikely that energy use is a root cause itself, but instead is likely to be an indicator that another underlying cause (namely development) is occuring.
Some research suggests urbanization as another factor which is likely related.
However, the abstract idea of development is a combination of all of these factors.
